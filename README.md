Thyroid Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 

Built a classification model, that is trained on a dataset from the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Sydney and it can predict hypothyroidism disease in human body.

Abstract:

Thyroid disease (TD) is one of the most progressive endocrine disorders in the human population today. 
According to statistics, thyroid disorders are on the rise in India. Approximately 1 in 10 Indian adults suffer 
from hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones to 
meet the needs of the body, and also one-third of thyroid patients are unaware of their condition. Prediction 
of endocrine disease is a critical task in the field of clinical data analysis.

Machine Learning (ML) has shown effective results in the decision-making and predictions from the 
enormous data generated by the healthcare domain. This project has proposed four models based on the 
primary thyroid disease dataset collected from 3772 patients from the Garvan Institute in Sydney, Australia.
In these models, we have compared 4 ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, Support Vector Machine, 
Decision Tree) for effective classification and built an optimum model to predict hypothyroidism disease
